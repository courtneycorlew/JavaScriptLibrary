    <h1> Test </h1>
    <script src="./index.js"></script>
    <p>
        In this lesson, we learned the strict mode. <br>
        The directive looks like a string: "use strict" or 'use strict'. When it is located on the top of the script, then the whole script works the “modern” way.<br>
        We need to ensure that "use strict" is at the top. <br>
        We also need to remember to always use strict. <br>
        Simply put "use strict" at the top.
