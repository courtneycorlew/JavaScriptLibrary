        In this lesson, we learned code structure.<br>
        I learned statements: such as alert. I also learned to use semicolons.<br>
        We then learned how to add comments to our JavaScript.<br>
        One-line comments start with two forward slash characters // <br>
        Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and a forward slash */.
